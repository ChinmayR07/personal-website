    "about":"Hello! I'm Chinmay Raichur, currently charting my academic journey at Stony Brook University, NY, where I am pursuing my Masters in Computer Engineering. My fascination with programming began at the tender age of 16 when I was introduced to Java. The sheer potential of code to address real-world problems captured my imagination. For me, programming isn't just about writing lines of code; it's about taking actionable steps to make the world a better place.\n\n ***Education and Professional Experience:*** \n Having embarked on this journey with Stony Brook University, I've been fortunate enough to accrue practical experience in the tech industry. With three enriching years at Accenture, I honed my skills as a full-stack developer. My recent summer internship at Trading Technologies Inc. has further solidified my understanding and expertise in the domain. \n\n ***Realms of Interest:*** \n Full stack development has always been my passion. The dual essence of working on both frontend and backend ensures that there's never a dull moment. Yet, of late, the world of systems has piqued my curiosity. I'm actively delving into it, eager to unravel its intricacies and deepen my knowledge.\n\n ***Outside the Tech World:*** \n Outside the realm of bits and bytes, I find solace and joy in music. Perhaps it's inherited—after all, my mother's melodious voice has always been a source of inspiration. Soft songs, in particular, resonate with my soul. And yes, there's another dream I nurture: launching my own YouTube channel. I envision it as a space where I can vlog my day-to-day adventures and share a slice of my life with an audience, bridging the gap between personal experiences and the virtual world.",
